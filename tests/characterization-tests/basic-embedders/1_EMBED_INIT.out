This is what I will do to initialize elm-embed:

    * Create a folder named `elm-embed-scripts` and place some Elm modules in
    there. This is the place where you will write you embedders later on.
    
    * Add `elm-embed-scripts` to your `source-directories` in `elm.json`.
    
    * Add elm/json to your direct dependencies.

Ok? [Y/n]: All done!
