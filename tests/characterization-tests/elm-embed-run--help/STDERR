    elm-embed run



Flags:

    --interpreter=<interpreter>
        Path to a alternate JS interpreter, like node or nodejs.
    
    --report=<report-type>
        You can say --report=json to get error messages as JSON. This is only
        really useful if you are an editor plugin. Humans should avoid it!
